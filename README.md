Project Name: Health Monitoring Web App for Nurse Practitioners and Patients

Description
This project develops a modern web application designed to assist nurse practitioners in monitoring their patients during the initial weeks after their release from the hospital. It also enables patients to monitor their daily activities, contributing to a seamless transition to normal life post-hospitalization. The backend is built using Express and implements GraphQL API, with data storage in MongoDB Cloud.

Features
Nurse Functionalities:
Vital Signs Entry: Nurses can record patients' vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
Access Historical Data: Nurses can access vital signs captured during previous clinical visits.
Generate Medical Condition List: Using deep learning on publicly available datasets, the app can suggest possible medical conditions based on the symptoms or data provided and advise patients to consult a doctor if necessary.

Patient Functionalities:
Daily Information Entry: Patients can enter daily information such as pulse rate, blood pressure, weight, temperature, and respiratory rate.
Symptom Checklist Submission: Patients can report common signs and symptoms (e.g., related to COVID-19) using a checklist.
Access to Fitness Games: Patients can access a page with fitness games designed to encourage exercise at home. These interactive games/pages aim to integrate fun into physical rehabilitation.

Technology Stack
Backend: Express for GraphQL API
Database: MongoDB Cloud
Frontend: React (Functional Components)
Styling: CSS, React Bootstrap, and other CSS libraries for responsive design
